Note: For case study #3 above, I modified some css on purpose:
A) Padding in the floatleft class has been changed to Margins. This was to solve
a problem where the clickable area was outside the images. The problem can be
seen by hovering the mouse 10 pixels to the right or bottom of the images while
using padding. Using margins limits the clickable area to the image. Having
clickable area outside the image seemed like a bug.

B) Added more margin-right to floatleft class. My website didn't have the same
amount of space between the image and the bulleted list on the Listings page, so
I set "margin-right: 40px" instead of 20px. I looked deeper into this and suspect
the list are the problem because changing the margin-right of the floatleft to 0
caused the bullets to overlap the image! I wonder if the author's lists are using
"list-style-position: inside", instead of the default "outside". Using inside
style fixed the spacing problem, but I prefered changing the margin-right instead.
