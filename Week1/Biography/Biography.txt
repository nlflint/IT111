Hello, my name is Nathan Flint. My wife and I live in Shoreline, and I work for a financial/stockmarket company in downtown Seattle developing financial software. I am taking this class because it is a requirement for the Application Development degree, which I would like to apply for as soon as the application process opens for next fall. I do not develop web apps professionally, but have had a great deal of exposure to them. I am looking forward to learning about design/asthetics.
