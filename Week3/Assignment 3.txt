IT 111 Chapter 3 Assignment

1. One advantage of using CSS is that site maintenance is easier and safer. If 
all a pages styles are defined in CSS, it is possible to change the entire theme
of a site by just changing the CSS file. Without CSS, all the elements of every
page on the site have to be handed edited. CSS can make changing syles faster,
easier, and less prone to human error.
